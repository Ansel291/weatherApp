# Fetch Functionality

See CurrentCondition.jsx file with lines 11 and 15 to see how Fetch Functionality was implemented to "Fetch Weather Conditions" before changing it to "Search Weather Conditions"

Also WeatherContext.js file contains commented out code for reverse Geo Location functionality, but decided to remove do to it taking 5 seconds to return reverse Geo Location data, therefore resulting in bad User Experience
